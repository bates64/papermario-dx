 * @brief N64 bootup and cache interfaces.
 *
 * The N64 system interface provides a way for code to interact with
 * the memory setup on the system.  This includes cache operations to
 * invalidate or flush regions and the ability to set the boot CIC.
 * The @ref system use the knowledge of the boot CIC to properly determine
 * if the expansion pak is present, giving 4 MiB of additional memory.  Aside
 * from this, the MIPS r4300 uses a manual cache management strategy, where
 * SW that requires passing buffers to and from hardware components using
 * DMA controllers needs to ensure that cache and RDRAM are in sync.  A
 * set of operations to invalidate and/or write back cache is provided for
 * both instruction cache and data cache.
